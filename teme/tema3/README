    Short description of the updated function of the project:

            The program works very similarly it's older iteration and it's core
        methods and flow is almost untouched. The only major addition to the flow
        are Producer class objects which are implemented in the simulation as
        follows:
            0.Initially, all Distributors apply their strategies and are
            assigned Producers based on them to fulfill their energy demands.
            1.Their monthly new data is read at the start of the month along
             with Distributor and Consumer data. Here they are marked as
             "changed"(information which is held in a boolean) and their new
             data loaded.
            2.At the end of the month, after all changes have been made to the
             other entities, all producers marked as changed will notify their
             Distributors(observers) of the change and they will reapply their
             respective strategies to be assigned new Producers.

        The rest of the explanation is done by comments in the actual code.

    Strategy patterns used in:
        - DistributorStrategy interface
        - GreenStrategy class
        - PriceStrategy class
        - QuantityStrategy class

    Observer patterns used in:
        - Producer class (observable)
        - Distributor class (observant)
